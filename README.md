# ios-quiz-app
I am learning to build an iOS app with SwiftUI. 

This is a quiz app with SwiftUI although tutorial was on UIKit

Challenges Faced

- navigation (I found it a bit uncomfortable unlike my experience with react-native and web)
- it's a bit harder to follow MVVM using SwiftUI, I think it's easier to follow the usual directory structure in React Native


Learnings (notable)

- closure
- custom components
